abstract = { Maintaining the Maximal Independent Set (MIS) in dynamic graphs is crucial for applications like resource allocation, load balancing, and network optimization. Traditional approaches require complete re-computation, making them inefficient for large and evolving graphs. Our proposed methods utilize Tuple Valued Bitmap (TVB) and its extension with levels, TVBL, to enhance parallelism and minimize search space. Experimental evaluations on large-scale graphs, ranging from 50 million to 1.2 billion edges, demonstrate significant speedups—up to 15.64x for insertions, with minimal impact on the MIS cardinality. This approach offers a scalable solution for dynamic graphs, paving the way for further optimization in fully dynamic and streaming settings. },

abstract = { Katz centrality measures a node’s influence within a network, considering the total number of walks between pairs of nodes rather than solely the shortest paths. This paper presents an algorithm for dynamically updating Katz centrality scores as the underlying graph evolves. Our method employs a frontier-based breadth-first search (BFS) to efficiently derive updated Katz scores in dynamic graphs. Notably, our algorithm accommodates node insertions and deletions, addressing a significant limitation of current state-of-the-art methods. },

abstract = { SimRank is a popular measure for evaluating node similarities in graphs, but its high computational cost limits scalability for large graphs. The ExactSim [1] algorithm achieves precise single-source SimRank similarities but suffers from significant computation time. In this work, we parallelize key components of ExactSim — Personalized PageRank (PPR) computations and SimRank calculations on a CPU-based shared memory multi-core system. By optimizing these modules, we significantly reduce runtime, making ExactSim more practical for large-scale applications. Our results (on graph sizes ranging from 0.1 million edges to 100 million edges) demonstrate the effectiveness of parallelization in improving both efficiency and scalability. },

abstract = { This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates machine learning techniques to optimize SimRank convergence on streaming data. Our approach utilizes the structural properties of the graph, such as edge features, to train a linear regression model that predicts SimRank values for newly added nodes. These predictions serve as effective initializations, ensuring faster convergence of the SimRank algorithm. By avoiding full recomputation and providing a new direction for research, our method offers a promising solution for similarity computation in evolving networks. },
