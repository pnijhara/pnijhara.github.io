Greetings everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I am Prajjwal Nijhara (PNIJHARA), an enthusiastic learner and currently pursuing a combined **M.Tech + Ph.D.** program in Computer Science at the prestigious **[Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur](https://iitj.ac.in/)**. I am dedicated to exploring the vast frontiers of computer science and contributing to its advancements through innovative research and development.

Apart from Computer Science, I am a listener and a reader and spend my not so much available free time listening to people's stories and reading psychology and poetry books. During my wonderful time at **[The Aligarh Muslim University](https://amu.ac.in/)**, I got introduced to Urdu poets and poetries and thus started writing some of my own.
Here is a small nugget of that.

Cheers!!

Jeet ki uthaayein bulandiyan hum tumhare saath hain,<br>
Haar na manzil, raahon mein humare saath hain.<br>
Chalte raho hamesha hamzad, hamein haar nahi,<br>
Zaat aur muqaddar ke parcham humare saath hain.<br>

<br>

We raise the heights of victory, together we stand,<br>
No defeat for us, we're always on the path hand in hand.<br>
Keep walking with comrades, never to accept defeat's decree,<br>
The flags of identity and destiny, with us they'll always be.<br>

<br>
